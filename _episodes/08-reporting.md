## Machine learning studies

The research literature is now abundant with machine learning studies, and it is fair to say that the quality of these studies is highly variable. There is an increasing pool of reporting guidelines that can help to improve quality of reporting of machine learning studies.

The Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model of Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis for Artificial Intelligence (TRIPOD) guidelines,
